# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
The purpose of this application is to provide a comprehensive backend solution for an 

ecommerce store. It leverages the power of various dependencies and programs such as 

Node.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and Express. By adhering to the set standards of Object 

Relational Mapping (ORM), the backend files have been meticulously designed and 

organized to ensure seamless communication between the application and the database.

## Usage

To begin using this application, you'll need to set up the database and import the 

necessary schema. Start by signing in to your MySQL database using your preferred 

client and creating a new database called "ecommerce". Once the database is created, 

locate the schema.sql file in the project's DB folder. Source this file in your MySQL 

client to create the required tables and define the schema for the application.

Next, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run 

the command npm install to install all the required dependencies for the application.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can import the data into the database. In 

the project's seeds folder, you'll find the index.js file. Run the command node seeds/

index.js to import the data into the database.

With the backend fully operational, you can now test the API functionality. Use a 

tool like Insomnia to send different fetch requests and observe the corresponding 

responses. This will allow you to interact with the backend and validate the expected behavior.
